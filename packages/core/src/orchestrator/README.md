# Orchestrator

This directory contains components responsible for orchestrating the execution of agents and managing the workflow of orders within the system.

## Directory Structure

- **adapters/** - Contains adapter implementations for different services and platforms that the orchestrator interacts with.
- **agent-runtime/** - Contains the runtime environment for executing agents, including agent lifecycle management and execution context.
- **order-manager/** - Contains components for managing orders, including order creation, status tracking, and completion handling.

## Purpose

The orchestrator is a central component of the system that:

1. Coordinates the execution of agents based on user orders
2. Manages the lifecycle of agent executions
3. Handles communication between different system components
4. Ensures proper execution flow and error handling

## When to Add Files Here

Add files to this directory when:

- Implementing new orchestration logic for agent execution
- Creating new adapters for external services
- Enhancing order management capabilities
- Implementing workflow coordination between system components
- Adding monitoring or observability for the orchestration process

## Best Practices

1. Keep orchestration logic separate from agent implementation details
2. Use dependency injection for services and adapters
3. Implement proper error handling and recovery mechanisms
4. Maintain clear separation of concerns between different orchestration components
5. Document the orchestration flow for complex workflows
